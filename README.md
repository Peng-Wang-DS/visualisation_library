visualisation_library

Welcome to visualisation_library — a lightweight toolkit designed to simplify and speed up common plotting tasks in data science.

In real-world data science workflows, projects often begin with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) or model evaluation, both of which require a large number of visualisations. Creating these plots repeatedly can become time-consuming and repetitive.

This library was created to streamline that process by providing pre-built, easy-to-use plotting classes. It is designed for my own productivity, but I am making it publicly available so others can benefit as well.
