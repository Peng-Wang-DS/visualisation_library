# visualisation_library

Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub repo **visualisation_library**.

In data science projects, work often begins with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** or **model performance inspection**, both of which require a large number of visualisations.

I found this process to be **time-consuming and repetitive**, so I created this library to provide a collection of simple, reusable plotting classes. It is intended to make visualisation faster and easier — for myself and for the public.
